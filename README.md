# FLW 01.5 // Code Along & Solo // Chat App

Why on earth (or space) is Darth sliding into Yoda's dms???

We need your JavaScript expertise to get this Chat App fully working to see how this conversation turns out!

## Code Along

#### As a class, declare variables for the following:
1. [X] The darth send button
2. [X] The yoda send button

## Code It Solo

#### Declare variables for the following:

3. [X] The darth input
4. [X] The yoda input
5. [X] The chat window

#### Next, we need to make this app interactive for our Darth Vader messages:

6. [X] Create an onclick event for the darth button
7. [X] Declare a variable for darth's message that saves the value of the darth input.
8. [X] Declare a variable that saves the message you want to append. Using string interpolation, make sure the darth message and darthImage variable are inside a div with the class name "darth-container".
9. [X] Add(append) the message to the chat window. Use the position beforeend.


#### Let's do the same for our Yoda messages:

10. [X] Create an onclick event for the yoda button.
11. [X] Declare a variable for yoda's message that saves the value of the yoda input.
12. [X] Declare a variable that saves the message you want to append. Using string interpolation, make sure the yoda message and yodaImage variable are inside a div with the class name "yoda-container".
13. Add(append) the message to the chat window. Use the position beforeend.


#### Finish the convo between Darth and Yoda!
